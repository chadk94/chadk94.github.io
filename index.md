### About Me

I started my undergraduate career at the University of North Carolina where I completed a degree in Economics with my second major in Global and Environmental Studies and a minor in PPE (Politics, Philosophy and Economics). After that I worked for two years at IHS Markit in a pair of roles, finishing my time as a Stock Surveillance Analyst where I worked with IRO's in the tech space. Currently I have completed my Master's degree at Duke (but nonetheless Go Heels!) in Economics and Computation with the goal of working in a software engineering or data science job following graduation. After my first year at Duke, I spent the summer interning with AWS as a software engineer. Personally, I spend much of my free time reading books (any good fantasy or history recommendations appreciated), or playing and watching basketball or ultimate frisbee!

  - *A machine learning projection process that takes basic boxscore stats from NBA games and given user option of a neural net to project future performance using a variety of different algorithims.*
- [Lineup Creator (C++)](https://github.com/chadk94/LineupCreator)
  - *Takes a csv of players, salaries and projected points and uses the Knapsack Method to generate optimal DFS lineup based on constraints (projection system and some additions omitted while profitable :-) )*
- [Season Simulator (Python)](linktoproject)
  - *Season simulator using Monte Carlo methods to generate probability distributions for various
outcomes*
- [Doodlebug(C++)](https://github.com/chadk94/Doodlebug/tree/master)
